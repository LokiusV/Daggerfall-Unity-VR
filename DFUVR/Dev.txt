TODO list:

collision with some weapons from WISA not working

interaction is broken

//Maybe just 2 sheaths instead?
able to use 2 weapons when one on each hand
- when off hand free, show a hand to swap
- when off hand occupied, show the other weapon
- grabbing that swaps to that thing
- impossible with shield (then shield equipped on off hand automatically)

wearable lanterns and torches
https://www.nexusmods.com/daggerfallunity/mods/391

spell selection menu

or quick menu with hand, like quick slots or like Skyrim/alyx -- Assigned: LokiusV //Maybe just last 4 casted spells? Would be easy to implement. Otherwise I'd add a menu entry in the VR settings menu

fix skybox
today the sky is inverted and quite wrong. fix it in Y coord and put it as far as possible to the background //Dynamic Skies(https://www.nexusmods.com/daggerfallunity/mods/376) support would be better! 

bow and arrow -- Assigned: LokiusV (low prio)
- bow on off hand
- get arrow on main hand quiver

hold weapons with 2 hands (if weapon is 2 handed)

weight on weapons
use weight directly from weapons

better compass and health
removing the fake blocks with actual hud

proper VR hands
still show hand when not holding weapon

menu interactions by grabbing things on the body --Assigned: LokiusV
- book to check quests
- map for map
- compass for local map
- pouch for inventory
- travel
- character sheet

Fallout4VR/SkyrimVR-like looting menu --Assigned: LokiusV

some ui screens as interactive things
- char sheet as a piece of paper
- map as an actual map
- log and notebooks as notebooks
other hand used to navigate where needed (so equipping only 1 single hand weapon could be better?)
some screens should still be full screen to stop gameplay

In-game VR settings menu: --Assigned: LokiusV(very high prio)
  - Basic settings:
    - Controller type
    - refresh rate
  - Calibration settings:
    - Sheath position
    - Height
    - Body slots
  - Comfort settings:
    - turn style
    - toggle run

min speed to cause attack to trigger
speed increases damage (increases minimum damage, do not touch max) //optional setting? Could be bad when playing seated.

remove self from triggering hits from weapon
filter on the collision method

better settings file
- add "setting=value"

fix keyboard numbers

better death
- disable weapons
- maybe red tint on screen?

make max attacks based on the weapon stats

fix loading screen being right next to your face

move scroll bar with sticks

improve speed of the sheath model

improve joystick handling on the code //? Already uses mostly new input system. All occurences of old one are to keep compatibility with the DFU binding menu

show what the controls do when holding the alt button

easier way to quick save and load -- Assigned: LokiusV//Button in the VR settings menu

hide weapon on menu
