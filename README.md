# Daggerfall-Unity-VR
 A VR mod for the open source recreation of the classic 1996 RPG Daggerfall in the Unity engine, called 'Daggerfall Unity'

# This repository is still a work in progress. 

Currently known issues:
 - UI is only visible when monitor resolution is set to 1920x1080
 - The VR laser-pointer is not very precise when clicking on the outer edges of the UI
 - Climbing does not work
 - the UI occasionally spawns directly in the face of the user
